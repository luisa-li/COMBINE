# COMBINE

A series of code written for the COMBINE lab. 

- particle_collision.py was a first attempt at simulating argon, but with very little physics basis. Particles collide with each other and with the wall elastically, but do not behave like argon, but it does look pretty cool. 
- argon_simulation is the physically correct simulation of argon, with a whole lot of (hopefully) correct physics, math, derivatives and units. 
- monte_carlo.py is a quick script that estimates the value of pi with a Monte Carlo method. 
- amber_tutorials holds some of the analysis code while running amber tutorials.
